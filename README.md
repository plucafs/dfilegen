Generate .desktop file easily

Why?
-
While I was trying Manjaro Gnome on my laptop I found difficult organize all the apps not available in the store (so AppImage and executable in general). I had problems with AppImage Launcher and I decided to not activate AUR due to security concerns.
There weren't other solutions available than doing the program I needed, by myself.

How it works?
-
Fill all the spaces with the information needed and click on the button. It'll be saved in the same directory in which you're running the program. 
Then, copy the file and paste it in home/.local/share/applications 

It'll be availabe only for the current user and will appear in the app menu.

Tips and tricks
-
- In the "Icon" space you can write only the name of the program if an icon with the same name exists in the icon folder of your system in Computer/usr/share/icons

What's next?
-
- Save in a custom directory (ideally with home/.local/share/applications as the default)
- Feel free to propose something!
