Generate .desktop file easily

Why?
-
While I was trying Manjaro Gnome on my laptop I found difficult organize all the apps not available in the store (so AppImage and executable in general). I had problems with AppImage Launcher and I decided to not activate AUR due to security concerns.
There weren't other solutions available than doing the program I needed, by myself.

How it works?
-
Fill all the spaces with the information needed and click on the button. On Windows you can select where the file will be saved, in Linux is saved in the same directory in which you're running this program. 
Then, copy the file and paste it in home/.local/share/applications (only for the current user). It'll appear in the app menu.
